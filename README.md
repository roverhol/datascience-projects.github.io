## Sample Projects from the Data Science Program at Oregon Tech

### Introduction

Students in the data science program at Oregon Tech complete a series of projects during their junior year. These projects are related to topics from courses in basic statistics, machine learning, databases and programming. 

This repository of sample projects is being constructed during the academic year 2021-2022, as our first cohort of students goes through the junior project sequence.
